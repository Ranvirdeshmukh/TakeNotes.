# Title TakeNotes website.

*description*
I have made an app called TakeNotes. This a really cool note taking app, which covers the whole lab assingment and even many extra credits.

## What Worked Well
Everything went well for me in this project and did many of the extra credits too. Got to understand a lot of specifics into using the react and using it well. Took help from chat GPT for the CSS part of it and even some of ther firebase authentication.

## Extra Credit
- Add in authentication with Firebase Users. We haven’t covered authentication but Firebase provides a nice auth api.
- zIndex sorting
- Undo feature
- Some method of note organization such as show-all.
- Resizable notes
